uSK8 was a mod for Unreal/Tournament back in the day. I have some umod/exe/zip packages floating around but it'd be nice to track down the authors of the mod for some more info.

Mod was never finished only hitting alpha state I believe.

The first level was school looking thing bunch of ramps, some odd mechanics. Still fairly cool for its time
